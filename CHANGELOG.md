### Breaking changes

* Chart 1.11 introduces a number of breaking changes, both in the chart itself
  and in its dependencies. Please read through the upgrade instructions for
  [chart 1.9](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/main/charts/kong/UPGRADE.md#190),
  [chart 1.10](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/main/charts/kong/UPGRADE.md#1100),
  and [chart 1.11](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/main/charts/kong/UPGRADE.md#1111)
  for details.
* In particular, if you use a Postgres-backed deployment, review the chart 1.9
  instructions for the [new Postgres readiness check script](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/main/charts/kong/UPGRADE.md#changes-to-wait-for-postgres-image).
  These changes require that you perform an initial upgrade without changing
  the Kong image version with migrations disabled before re-enabling migrations
  and setting a new Kong image.
